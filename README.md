This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Hacker Cabin Members Projects

Just a quick experiment with Next.js and Google Spreadsheets as a source for data

Using :
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [ShadcnUI](https://shadcnui.com/)
- [google-spreadsheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet)

If you want to clone it, you will then need to create a `.env.local` file that you can copy from `.env.example` and put your own credentials in. (https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/guides/authentication?id=setting-up-your-quotapplicationquot)

Feel free to contribute, especially UI wise.
